# Stream-HLS Artifacts

This directory contains all the HLS designs generated by Stream-HLS. The designs are synthesized and RTL-simulated using Vitis HLS 2023.2. Stream-HLS designs are generated from the `examples` directory. Designs of prior works are either collected [Allo artifacts](https://github.com/cornell-zhang/allo-pldi24-artifact) or generated using the specific tool.

The reports are saved into csv files and copied into the `results` directory to generate the data reported in the paper. For each table in the paper, there is a Python script that generates it.
